# Spartacus Capybara

This is an implementation of [Capybara theme for Vue Storefront](https://github.com/DivanteLtd/vsf-capybara) but in [SAP Spartacus Storefront](https://github.com/SAP/spartacus). You can treat this repository as a sample Spartacus implementation or a starter code. Feel free to look around and get inspired.

Most of the work has been done already. However, we are still developing and enhancing it.

## ‚òëÔ∏è  Requirements

This project is based on [Spartacus Storefront](https://github.com/SAP/spartacus) so the requirements are the same and can be found [here](https://github.com/SAP/spartacus#requirements).

## üîå  Installation

1. `yarn install`
2. `yarn start`
3. open [localhost:4200](http://localhost:4200)

## üìì  Notes for developers

We are using a public SAP Commerce Cloud (CCv2) instance as a backend - the same which is used by [Spartacus Public instance](https://spartacus.c39j2-walkersde1-d4-public.model-t.cc.commerce.ondemand.com/electronics-spa/en/USD/). Because of this we had to provide some static CMS configuration. In production environment this configuration could be migrated to an impex and served from the cms.
